# Week1-Homework

# Objective:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# Explanation:

What I took away from this homework is how to "clean up" and put detail into code by using semantic elements. Given that <div> has no specific meaning, I used other semantic elements to further define each line of code. In addition to replacing <div> with their cooresponding semantic elements, I also edited the spacing of this code to make it easier to read. The most difficult part of this assignment for me was figuring out the spacing on the NavBar.
